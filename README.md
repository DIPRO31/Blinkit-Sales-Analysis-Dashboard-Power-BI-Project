# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
Transforming Data into Actionable Insights
I’m excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard project, where I conducted a comprehensive sales performance analysis for Blinkit, India’s last-minute grocery app.

🔧 Tools & Skills Used:

Power BI for building visual dashboards

Power Query Editor for complete ETL process (Data Cleaning, Transformation & Loading)

DAX for calculated measures and KPIs

Data Visualization techniques to drive business decisions

📊 Key KPIs Developed:

💰 Total Sales – $1.20M (Overall revenue from all items sold)

📈 Average Sales – $141 (Revenue per item sold)

📦 Number of Items – 8,523

⭐ Average Rating – 3.9 (Customer feedback)

📌 Business Requirements Fulfilled:

Fat Content Analysis (Low Fat vs Regular) using Donut Charts

Sales by Item Type – Bar Chart showing which product categories drive revenue

Fat Content by Outlet Tier – Stacked Column Chart for regional health trends

Sales Over Years by Establishment Type – Line Chart to visualize sales trends

Sales by Outlet Size – Donut Chart to correlate outlet scale and sales

Sales by Outlet Location – Funnel visualization for geographic impact

All KPI Metrics by Outlet Type – Matrix Card for complete performance overview

📥 Insights Derived:

Tier 3 locations and Regular fat items are leading in sales.

Supermarket Type 1 is the top-performing outlet category.

Fruits & Snacks contribute the most to total revenue.

There’s a sales dip post-2018, demanding a revisit to outlet strategies.

✅ This project helped me sharpen my data storytelling, business intelligence, and dashboard design skills.

📌 Why This Matters?
Retail & e-grocery businesses can use similar dashboards to monitor real-time KPIs, optimize inventory, understand consumer preferences, and make data-driven decisions.
